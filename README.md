# UFO

### Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage that allows users to research and analysis UFO sightings across the world. We were able to build interactive filters that allows the user to locate specific criteria that matches what they are looking for such as location, date of sighting, and the shape of the aircraft.

### Results
To use this website, all you have to do is use the filters presented to location the information specifically of what you are looking for. Without the filters, there are hundred of data to look through but narrowing down your search based on own specifics will save you lots of time. Below are some images that represent how the filters can be used and what the results would look like.

### Summary
The drawback of this design is that it only uses the data that is already collected. The data file used would need to be updated consistantly in order to beneficial for future UFO enthusiasts.
Two recommendations that could make this better is having a tool that would allow the user to export their filtered results into an Excel or PDF format for their own use. Another recommendation would spend some more time making this site more eye appealing and modern that is comparable to today's websites. Although, I must say, being able to make this alone with just a weeks worth of knowledge is very satisfying!!
